Readme::

The Sapporo-(DKH3)-xZP-2012 ( x = D, T, and Q ) sets are all-elctron, segmented contraction GTF sets.
The orbital exponents and contraction coefficients were determined to reproduce very accurate
atomic natural orbitals of each atom. The non-relativistic basis sets named Sapporo-xZP-2012 sets are
prepared for the H throuh Xe atoms. The relativistic basis set named Sapporo-DKH3-xZP-2012
are prepared for the K through Rn atoms. For each type of basis set, we added diffuse primitives
for all the azimutual quantum numbers appeared in the basis set, named Sapporo-(DKH3)-xZP-2012-diffuse.
These basis sets in both xml and nwchem format are sotored in the following directories.
