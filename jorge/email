Dear Benjamin

I hope everything is fine with you.
We would appreciate if you made available the non-relativistic (ADZP, 
ATZP, AQZP, and A5ZP) and relativistic (TZP-ZORA) basis sets (see 
attached files) developed by our research group on the new Basis Set 
Exchange website.

Best regards,

Francisco Elias Jorge
