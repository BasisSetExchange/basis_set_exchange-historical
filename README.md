# Basis Set Exchange - Historical/Provenance Data

This is a collection of historical basis set data used when creating the basis
set exchange (both the original and the newer version)

## Contents

### bse-xml

Data from the original PNNL basis set exchange in XML format. Thanks to
Tara Gibson, Brett Didier, Phil Gackle, and Edo Apra for helping me
obtain and interpret these files.

These files come from the `store/content/files/projects/Basis_Set_Curators/Gaussian`
subdirectory of the BSE source. They have the `_1.0` suffix stripped and are then
compressed. 


### bse-formatted

Actual output of the BSE in the various formats (nwchem, etc). Every basis
set and format combination are here.

Only the basis sets marked 'published' were downloaded.

Obtained 2018-05-09 through 2018-05-10 via a script that downloads from the
BSE website.


### GAMESS

Data pulled from GAMESS, either via source or by running test calculations.
Thanks to Ellie Fought for helping obtain this data.
